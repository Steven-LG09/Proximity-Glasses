# 👓 Proximity Glasses with Arduino Uno

This project is a prototype of **proximity-detecting smart glasses** built using an **Arduino Uno**. It helps detect nearby obstacles and alert the user through sound, ideal for assisting people with visual impairments or enhancing spatial awareness in specific environments.

## 🧰 Features

- Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement  
- Buzzer to alert when obstacles are nearby  
- Adjustable sensitivity  
- Lightweight and wearable design prototype

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Buzzer 
- Battery pack  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  
- Glasses frame or holder  

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The ultrasonic sensor constantly measures the distance to nearby objects.  
2. When an obstacle is detected within a set range (e.g., 50 cm), the buzzer.  
3. The user receives an immediate alert and can react accordingly.
